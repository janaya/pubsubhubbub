PubSubHubbub Hub Test Suite
---------------------------

This suite is intended to be used for hub compliancy. The test examples came 
directly from the current 0.1 PubSubHubbub Core working draft. However, not 
everything can be tested currently. This may change as the spec changes.

This requires Ruby and RSpec, the later which can be installed with Ruby Gems
using "gem install rspec". RSpec is a great approach to testing and Ruby allows
for nice DSL-like testing. The interface is HTTP, so it's language independent.

Using the Test Suite:

$ HUB_URL=<url to hub> spec hub_spec.rb --format specdoc

Example:

$ HUB_URL=http://localhost:8000 spec hub_spec.rb --format specdoc

If your publish and subscribe endpoints are not /publish and /subscribe 
respectively, you can specify them with the PUBLISH_PATH and SUBSCRIBE_PATH 
environment variables along with HUB_URL.
